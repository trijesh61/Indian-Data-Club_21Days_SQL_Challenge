-- 1. Extract the year from all patient arrival dates
SELECT 
    patient_id, 
    YEAR(arrival_date) AS arrival_year 
FROM patients;


-- 2. Calculate the length of stay for each patient (departure_date - arrival_date)
SELECT 
    patient_id,
    name,
    DATEDIFF(departure_date, arrival_date) AS stay_days
FROM patients;


-- 3. Find the total number of patients who arrived in each month
SELECT 
    MONTH(arrival_date) AS arrived_month,
    COUNT(*) AS total_patients
FROM patients
GROUP BY arrived_month
ORDER BY arrived_month;


-- Daily Challenge:
-- 4. Calculate the average length of stay (in days) for each service
-- Show only services where the average stay is greater than 7 days
-- Also show the count of patients and order by average stay descending
SELECT 
    service,
    COUNT(patient_id) AS total_patients,
    ROUND(AVG(DATEDIFF(departure_date, arrival_date)), 2) AS avg_stay_days
FROM patients
GROUP BY service
HAVING AVG(DATEDIFF(departure_date, arrival_date)) > 7
ORDER BY avg_stay_days DESC;
