-- 1. Combine patient names and staff names into a single list.
SELECT name 
FROM patients
UNION 
SELECT staff_name 
FROM staff
ORDER BY name;


-- 2. Create a union of high satisfaction patients (>90) and low satisfaction patients (<50).
SELECT patient_id, name, satisfaction
FROM patients 
WHERE satisfaction>90
UNION
SELECT patient_id, name, satisfaction
FROM patients
WHERE satisfaction<50;


-- 3. List all unique names from both patients and staff tables.

-- Daily Challenge:
-- Create a comprehensive personnel and patient list showing: 
-- identifier (patient_id or staff_id), full name, type ('Patient' or 'Staff'), and associated service. 
-- Include only those in 'surgery' or 'emergency' services. Order by type, then service, then name.
SELECT patient_id, name AS full_name, service, 'Patient' AS type
FROM patients
WHERE service IN ('surgery','emergency')
UNION
SELECT staff_id, staff_name AS full_name, service, 'Staff' AS type
FROM staff
WHERE service IN ('surgery','emergency')
ORDER BY type, service, full_name;
